# AMU_DHC_Dataset
The ADHC (AMU DEVANAGARI HANDWRITTEN CHARACTER) dataset is a large collection of characters
handwritten in Devanagari script.
The ADHC Dataset was developed in two versions as a part of two Hackathons on 
Machine Learning - HACKTELLIGENCE’21 and HACKTELLIGENCE’22, organized by the Interdisciplinary Centre 
for Artificial Intelligence, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India. 
The ADHC datasets were generated by imaging the characters written by many individuals in different writing styles. 
We scanned these handwritten documents of different writers and cropped each character. Each image in the dataset 
is unique. 
The released Dataset is randomly split into Training and Testing set and provided in both CSV and PNG 
image format.
